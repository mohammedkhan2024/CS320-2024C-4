# CS320 Module Eight Journal

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- To make sure my code or software works well and is secure, I start by writing clear and organized code. I test my code thoroughly with unit tests to check individual parts and integration tests to see how everything works together. I keep my software updated to fix any security issues, and I use secure coding practices like checking inputs and using strong authentication. I also have others review my code and conduct security checks to catch any problems that I might have overlooked.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- To understand what users need, I would schedule meetings and talk to them and observe how they work. I first learn about their problems and what they expect from the software. I then turn these needs into clear requirements or user stories that guide what the software should do. As I build the program, I keep checking with users by showing them prototypes or early versions to make sure I’m meeting their needs.

### How do I approach designing software?

- When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and what’s required. I break the system down into smaller parts, each with a specific job. I use design principles like modularity and separation of concerns to create a structure that’s easy to manage and update. I create diagrams to visualize how the system will work. I think about both current needs and future growth. As I work on the project, I continuously refine my design based on new information and feedback.
